### Supporting files for [Quantum key distribution rates from semidefinite programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05725)

#### Mateus Araújo, Marcus Huber, Miguel Navascués, Matej Pivoluska, Armin Tavakoli

Code works in MATLAB and Octave. Requires the development version of [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) to run, and a SDP solver. Good choices are [SeDuMi](https://github.com/sqlp/sedumi) (open source, reliable, slow, runs on Octave) or [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) (proprietary, less reliable, fast, requires MATLAB).

The main files are

 - [mub_qkd.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/mub_qkd.m): Computes the key rate for the MUB protocol from section 4.1 assuming the probabilities of the isotropic state.
 - [subspace_qkd.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/subspace_qkd.m): Computes the key rate for the subspace protocol from section 4.2 assuming the probabilities of the isotropic state.
 - [overlap_qkd.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/overlap_qkd.m): Computes the key rate for the overlap protocol from section 4.3 assuming the probabilities of the isotropic state.
 - [matej_experiment_overlap.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/matej_experiment_overlap.m): Computes the key rate for the time-bin entanglement experiment described in section 5.1 with the overlap protocol.
 - [matej_experiment_subspace.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/matej_experiment_overlap.m): Computes the key rate for the time-bin entanglement experiment described in section 5.1 with the subspace protocol.
 - [mehul_experiment_full.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/mehul_experiment_full.m): Computes the key rate for the pixel entanglement experiment described in section 5.1 with the full MUB protocol.
 - [mehul_experiment_restricted.m](https://github.com/araujoms/qkd/blob/main/mehul_experiment_full.m): Computes the key rate for the pixel entanglement experiment described in section 5.1 with the restricted MUB protocol.
 
Additionaly, the "helpers" folder contains auxilliary functions needed to run the main code.
